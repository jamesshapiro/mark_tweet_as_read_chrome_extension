# mark_tweet_as_read_chrome_extension

Mark Tweets that you have already seen as read.

Previously viewed Tweets are stored in Chrome's local storage.

The motivation for this is for people who like to view Tweets chronologically and want to easily see when they have exhausted all new Tweets in a timeline.
